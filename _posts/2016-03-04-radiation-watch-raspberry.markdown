Finally I've made time to write the follow-up of this series about the Radiation Watch Pocket Geiger.

In [the first part][part_one] we were logging the radiation level offline using an Arduino with an SD card. As my title promises a Geiger counter for your house, we need to do better! Actually something more connected.

It will be great to post the radiation level online and in real-time. For that we need a board that we can easily connect to internet, but also still still be linked to our Pocket Geiger. Guess what? This is exactly what Raspberry Pi is great at!

So instead of connecting our Pocket Geiger to an Arduino board, we will wire it to the Raspberry Pi GPIO ports. We will benefit the Raspberry Pi generous package: Ethernet and USB ports, so the network access is simple ; it also have HDMI if you want to see what's you're doing on a screen. The computing power of the ARM chip is also way above the Arduino ATMEL microcontroller, so it can run a whole GNU/Linux distribution. We will enjoy the environment to rapidly hack some apps with Python.

Then you plug the wires to the GPIO pins and you're ready to go!" alt="Wiring of Pocket Geiger and Raspberry Pi" %}

The global picture is good, however we need a way to communicate and get the readings from the Pocket Geiger to our Raspberry Pi. As I found nothing convincing for that, I've developed a Python library for the purpose: please welcome [the PiPocketGeiger lib][PiPocketGeiger_lib].

The PiPocketGeiger library is built on top of the [RPi.GPIO] package. It uses edge signal interrupt to count the radiation and detect noisy condition.

Linux is not a proper real-time OS (note: that remarq apply only for the standard Raspbian distribution, has it do exist patched versions of Linux for real-time applications: TODO), so we have no garanty we're effectively monitor the edge falling in a timely manner. That said, with the use of interrupts the issue is less dramatic, and I have not observed any sensible variation in the readings compared to the Arduino library. TODO Make a live recording with RPi and Arduino in paralell.

You can install it on your Raspberry Pi using `pip`. The RPi.GPIO package need root privileges to read the pins, I thus recommend to install the lib root-wide:

```sudo install pip PiPocketGeiger
```

That done you can use the lib in your Python script, with only one line to initialize indicate the GPIO pins on which the Pocket Geiger is connected. Then you can get the current radiation level whenever you need.

```
# We initialize the lib with respectively the radiation signal and noise pins number.
with RadiationWatch(24, 23) as radiationWatch:
    print(radiationWatch.status())
    # {'duration': 14.9, 'uSvh': 0.081, 'uSvhError': 0.081, 'cpm': 4.29}
```

For those that already imagine reactive applications you can also register a callbacks that will be triggered in case of a radiation event, or when there is too much noise:

```
def onRadiation():
    print("Ray appeared!")
def onNoise():
    print("Vibration! Stop moving!")
with RadiationWatch(24, 23) as radiationWatch:
   radiationWatch.registerRadiationCallback(onRadiation)
   radiationWatch.registerNoiseCallback(onNoise)
   while 1:
       time.sleep(1)
```

Since this device seems good for background monitoring, I'll connect it to my Raspberry Pi and plot the data online in real-time. Stay tuned.


RPi: propose a built-case for 200 â‚¬. Monitore (to Safecast? to a backend of mime? to a custom endpoint?) as soon as you connect it to internet (Ethernet with DHCP).
