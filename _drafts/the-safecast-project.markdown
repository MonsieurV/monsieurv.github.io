Another project followed the Fukushima crisis: the bGeigie by Safecast provides a complete and full-pledged radiation sensor. Compared to the Radiation Watch Pocket Geiger, [it is not cheap][safecast_bgeigie_nano], but way more complete. Mobile radiation measurement. It comes as a kit to build and allows to monitor all Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiations. It can be considered as a whole system: provides an API. Map. Community.

Rpi: Connect this to the Safecast API for stationary measurements. TODO Send message to Safecast
