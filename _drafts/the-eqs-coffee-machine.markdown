One week ago² I was invited to the Equisense brand new office (Facebook pic) for their first Hackaton. Whether doing a hackaton in 2016 is a late-arrival game that should be reserved to jetlag corporate company, it was a nice moment!

² Note: Actually it was more like two month ago, but I do am very lazy, only now I publish the article. This don't make really serious, and who Morbleu don't want to be serious? So I prefer to falsify the reality.

What else?

Good for you! Do you really think doing your coffee yourself is great when you're George Clooney? Are we not in 2016 motherfucker?

Better not push anymore theses buttons yourself for now!

Do it by your robots!

As Andrew Hunt and David Thomas put it in the Pragmatic Programmer:

I also pick their own Alfred North Whitehead quote:

With no doubt coffee is one of them. We shouldn't have to think of it hard to brew a coffee!

Maybe one day we'll have the IA that have the instinct for when we want our coffee.

Robot to take the coffee to the desk. Clearly that's the next step!
