Some month ago a [client of mime][effi_synchrone] have offered me a Geiger counter kit from [the Radiation Watch project][]. The last few weeks I was able to take the the time to play with.

Radiation Watch is a scientific and citizen initiative born after the Fukushima Daiishi disaster. The project have been founded [on Kickstarter][rw_ks] by N people TODO date. It aims to provide a cheap and accessible radiation sensor for monitoring gamma radiation.

In the case you don't remember well - or never knew - here how we usually classify radiations: we distinguish between Alpha, Beta and Gamma rays. What is especially remarkable is that the three have longueur d'onde croissante, which induce their capacity to traverse the universe. Ainsi a simple sheet of paper or layer of clooth suffice to block alpha radiations; as for beta rays you'll need to stay behind ?? to be protected from a source. Finally the gamma rays are only stopped by ???: they're the one to which we are naturally exposed. If you don't play with direct sources like [Marie Curie][] or don't [go around][] in a highly contaminated site you won't be exposed to significant level of alpha or beta rays.

Rayonnement alpha & beta: exposition naturelle ? Soleil ?

Schema of radiation, longueur d'onde, and isolation.

Relation between radioactivity and radiation dose. The Sievert unit.

Ok, I really don't know much about radioactivity so now better // let's begin to speak code.

The Radiation Watch is a no-brainer to interface with your arduino: 4 wires to connect directly and you're done. Near all the complexity is embedded on the Pocket Geiger card: and you don't have to worry about it.

Provide a better firmware. IRQ, cleaned code, clearer interface and reduced memory footprint.

SD card data logging.

All is good, and for one purpose: measure the background radiation level. We'll see here what it can gives you.

Surprinsgly I was able to take measurements being in a train. I expected the vibration to fuck up, but it wasn't the case. The accelerometer wasn't triggering the noise detection pin and the data seems plausible.

Plot on the train from (1h avant Bordeaux ?) to Agen

Finally Go to Golfech and make some background measurements for 2 hours.

Since this device seems good for background monitoring, I'll connect it to my Raspberry Pi and plot the data online in real-time. Stay tuned.

Another project followed the Fukushima crisis: the bGeigie by Safecast provides a complete and full-pledged radiation sensor. Compared to the Radiation Watch Pocket geiger, [it is not cheap][safecast_bgeigie_nano], but way more complete. Mobile radiation measurement. It comes as a kit to build and allows to monitor all Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiations. It can be considered as a whole system: provides an API. Map. Community.

Rpi: Connect this to the Safecast API for stationary measurements. TODO Send message to Safecast

RPi: propose a built-case for 200 â‚¬. Monitore (to Safecast? to a backend of mime? to a custom endpoint?) as soon as you connect it to internet (Ethernet with DHCP).
