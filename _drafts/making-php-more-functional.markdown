## PHP: for hackers that don't hack

Going from nowhere to somewhere without getting an idea of what you're doing.

Examples (Nubio, Facebook)

## This is not even that bad

Package / dependency manager: Composer

Facebook recognition: Hack language. (Language upgrade: async/await, etc.)

The truth is here: with PHP, you can go/range from the _I echo HTML_ to
professional and near virtuoso programming.

Ok, near.

## The functional touch

Examples without / with the PHP touch

Search some typical functional forms in SICP. PG Common Lisp. Find some practical
ones: PHP is always very pragmatic.

## Enter Bottomline

Like a Javascript Lodash, it intends to give a more consistent feeling and good
utilities when adopting functional forms/[se dit d'une utilisation typique d'une forme de language].

## The eternal PHP sketchy feeling

What is still [bancal] due to PHP awkwardness. (syntax, issues when using FP forms)

* Passing functions (e.g. `__::map([1, 3, 'hi'])`, 'is_int': too many params.
Check what it do in Scheme, Common Lisp, Hy and Javascript)

It that really an issue when you're just there to get things done?
There's not so much chance you choose PHP for its beauty / the beauty of the language.

## What PHP could copy from Lisp

In the [] (near) every evolving (great) language copy something from Lisp [Link to PG],
what could do PHP and how it will be better.
