Follow-up of my article about the Pocket Geiger. So far we were data logging the radiation level offline. I was promising a counter for your house: we need to do better.

Since this device seems good for background monitoring, I'll connect it to my Raspberry Pi and plot the data online in real-time. Stay tuned.

Another project followed the Fukushima crisis: the bGeigie by Safecast provides a complete and full-pledged radiation sensor. Compared to the Radiation Watch Pocket geiger, [it is not cheap][safecast_bgeigie_nano], but way more complete. Mobile radiation measurement. It comes as a kit to build and allows to monitor all Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiations. It can be considered as a whole system: provides an API. Map. Community.

Rpi: Connect this to the Safecast API for stationary measurements. TODO Send message to Safecast

RPi: propose a built-case for 200 â‚¬. Monitore (to Safecast? to a backend of mime? to a custom endpoint?) as soon as you connect it to internet (Ethernet with DHCP).
